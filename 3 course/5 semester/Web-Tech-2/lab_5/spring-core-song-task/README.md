# Song

The goal of this task is to practice with properties and corresponding Spring annotations (`@PropertySource`, `@Value`).

Duration: _10 minutes_

## Description

1. Create a `Song` class with the following attributes: _title_, _artist_ and _year_. The class should have appropriate getter and setter methods for its attribute.
2. Fill out the _application.properties_ file with song properties: 
   1. Title = "Only the young"
   2. Artist = "Taylor Swift"
   3. Year = "2020"
3. Follow best practices to set the `Song` class properties from the _application.properties_ file.
